# Volunteering

Ethereum Classic development actively underway by a decentralized community development initiative run by volunteers. It is an open organization where people are judged solely on the quality of their contributions.

Are you interested in volunteering your time to help the development of Ethereum Classic? Post in the issues section, tell us about yourself and we will try to help you find a place you can contribute to Ethereum Classic development.

If you are interested in community organizing, you can find more information about volunteering with other community organizers here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic

## Community

## Structure

I propose we operate our development in a similar fashion to Angel
volunteer system found at CCC events. Existing volunteers will do their best to
help new volunteers, but there is no strict leadership heirachy.
Instead of a chain of command, I propose we operate on a merit system, you are judged only on your code & discussion
contributions, not your age, race, gender, sex, nationality or anything else, just
the what you contribute. You do not even need to own any Ethereum classic, if you have a good idea or a well reasoned contribution, that is all that matters.

If you see anything that needs to be fixed and you are capable, please
fix it. Create a local fork, make the change and submit a pull
request. Everyone is currently working in a volunteer capacity, the fastest way to enact changes is to create pull requests.


If you want to make fundamental changes to the system please consult
with your peers, have them review your code, and make sure we have
consensus. If the issue is contentious we should work to include the input of the wider
community.

Any donations received will be fairly distributed among active volunteers.

## Objective

Our primary priority is maintaining existing clients currently maintained by the ICO backed Ethereum Foundation with DAO hard fork code removed to ensure easy access to the original/classic Ethereum network. We do this by keeping up with upstream patches for every major client and provide an alternative which does not require the user to use a special flag to run a node on the original/classi Ethereum network. 

As more people volunteer we can shift our focus, begin to close issues shared by both ourselves and the upstream developers. In my opinion, we should first start with restoration and access to the original/classic Ethereum network and move to a focus on security oriented updates while the growing developer community discusses and builds a roadmap for future updates to the system and which clients and projects we should support with community development.

## Projects

A wide variety of projects need assistance, regardless of your experience, if you are interested, you should volunteer. A diversity of perspectives is important and anything you don't yet know, you can learn over time.

### Associated Projects

Working on a project using ETC and looking for collaborators? Feel free to add it to this list.

**Blockchain Explorer** http://explorer.etherhub.io

ETC Block Explorer public board https://trello.com/b/W3ftl57z/etc-block-explorer-development 

https://github.com/ethereumproject/explorer - In response to none of the existing major Ethereum blockchain explorers being open source, as a community we have decided to develop a quality open source block chain explorer. Providing an open source solution which allows for easy verification of contracts supports increased contract complexity within the ecosystem.

Contacts: Slack @elaine, @sianyu, @dontpanicburns

**Social Fork Analysis**

https://github.com/ethereumproject/social-fork-analysis - A citizen journalism project doing social network analysis with the goal of creating an easy to use data set for journalists and researchers.

Contacts: IRC Server oftc.net, channel #etc-dev, @whatisgravity

**ETC-CX-Wallet**

https://github.com/realcodywburns/ETC-CX-Wallet - Ethereum classic chrome extension wallet. This project is a sub-project of https://github.com/ethereumproject/etherwallet

Contacts: Slack @dontpanicburns

**GimmeDapp**

https://github.com/realcodywburns/gimme-dapp - A social platform for the developer community to showcase their dapps and let the community upvote, downvote, or comment on the ideas.

Contacts: Slack @dontpanicburns


**Open Oracle Project** 

https://github.com/ethereumproject/Open-Oracle-Project - Open Oracle project is a public utility to inject web/API data into the Ethereum Classic Blockchain to trigger smart contracts easily, securely and cheaply. Looking for volunteers that would like to be a part of this project.

Key skills/expertise required:

1. API's
2. Backend
3. Smart Contracts / Solidity
4. Consensus Mechanisms/Algorithms

https://github.com/ethereumproject/volunteer/issues/16

Contacts: Slack @avtarsehra

**Tortuga**

https://github.com/realcodywburns/tortuga - Localbitcoins for ETC traded on chain

Contacts: Slack @dontpanicburns


**Multisig Trust Contract**

A contract to serve as a trust for development
and general enough to be repurposed for needs. This would allow donations to developers to be managed in a
transparent way and access can be controlled by active developers who
have built trust with the community. 


**Visual smart contract language**

https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/23

Solidity is not well understood by general people specially lawyers of the future.

A code generator that translates Ethereum Classic UML like smart contracts to Solidity language utilizing for example Acceleo and Papyrus plugins inside Eclipse would improve the issue. That is basically a model to text transformation whereas the model is UML and the text is Solidity code.

In the end a model to text transformation powered by Acceleo Engine would be running to compile that in the backstage.

## Volunteer GPG Keys

https://github.com/ethereumproject/volunteer/tree/master/Volunteer-Public-Keys - GPG keys of volunteers on the Ethereum Classic project

## Public Trello Boards

We need simple, visual way to coordinate plans and assignments. To make the processes in the organization transparent we are using public Trello boards. 

For those of you who is not familiar with Trello. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes projects into boards. In one glance, Trello shows you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. It is an easy way for volunteers to quickly find tasks they can immediately work on.

These boards are public and everyone can see the progress. Write access can be granted after a established track record of activity in Ethereum Classic Project.
