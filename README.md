# Volunteering

Are you interested in volunteering your time to help the development of Ethereum Classic? Post in the issues section, tell us about yourself and we will try to help you find a place you can contribute to Ethereum Classic development. This is a decentralized project run by volunteers.

If you are interested in community organizing, you can find more information about volunteering with other community organizers here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic

## Structure

I propose we operate our development in a similar fashion to Angel
volunteer system found at CCC events. Existing volunteers will do their best to
help new volunteers, but there is no strict leadership heirachy.
Instead of a chain of command, I propose we operate on a merit system, you are judged only on your code & discussion
contributions, not your age, race, gender, sex, nationality or anything else, just
the code you commit. You do not even need to own any Ethereum classic, if you have a good idea or a well reasoned contribution, that is all that matters. Any donations received will be fairly distributed among active volunteers.

If you see anything that needs to be fixed and you are capable, please
fix it. Create a local fork, make the change and submit a pull
request.

If you want to make fundamental changes to the system please consult
with your peers, have them review your code, and make sure we have
consensus. If the issue is contentious we should work to include the input of the wider
community.


## Projects
A wide variety of projects need assistance, and support for languages not yet supported is also appreciated. 

**Ethereum Classic Clients**
Our primary activity until we have enough volunteers is to maintain existing clients maintained by the ICO backed Ethereum Foundation with DAO hard fork code removed. Our goal is to keep up with upstream patches for every major client and provide an alternative which does not require the user to use a special flag to run a node on the Ethereum classic network. 

As we get more volunteers we can begin to close issues and focus on security oriented updates while we discuss and build a roadmap for future updates to the system.

**Blockchain Explorer**
We would like to maintain an open source blockchain explorer that is capable of verifying contracts with their compiled counterparts. This project is not directly related to the protocol, it does make the protocol more useful. If anyone is interested in assisting existing open source Ethereum block explorers or starting their own please notify us so we can contribute.

**Multisig Trust Contract**
A contract to serve as a trust for development
and general enough to be repurposed for needs. This would allow donations to developers to be managed in a
transparent way and access can be controlled by active developers who
have built trust with the community. 

**Visual smart contract language**
Solidity is not well understood by general people specially lawyers of the future.
https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/23

A code generator that translates Ethereum Classic UML like smart contracts to Solidity language utilizing for example Acceleo and Papyrus plugins inside Eclipse would improve the issue. That is basically a model to text transformation whereas the model is UML and the text is Solidity code.

In the end a model to text transformation powered by Acceleo Engine would be running to compile that in the backstage.

... more to come ...
